# MID-fMRI
Monetary Incentive Delay task for fMRI, for children

This is a task to be run in the scanner. All files are needed in order to run the script, as well as an empty folder labelled "data". 
The "makeEVs.py" must be modified per group and per location of log files. Currently set up for use on server. 

% Modeled after the MID task from the ABCD study, which was modeled after
% (Knutson, 2000)


% Each trial consisted of four events:

% 1.First, subjects are presented with an incentive cue (2000 ms) of five
% possible values (gain of $0.20, $5.00; loss of $0.20, $5.00; or no change
% $0). All participants begin with $1.
% 
% 2. This is followed by a 2000 ms anticipation delay (fixation cross).
% 
% 3. Next, a target appears. Initial target wait time is determined by
% performance in practice round (10 trials) outside of scanner (2 of each cue type). During
% experiment, target appears for a for a variable length of time
% dynamically manipulated and individually based such that overall success
% rate is approximately 60% during which subjects make a button press
% response in an attempt to gain or avoid losing the money. Subjects are
% instructed to respond to neutral targets despite the lack of incentive
% value.
% 
% 4. A feedback message informs them of the trial outcome.
% 
% The incentive trial is presented contiguously in a random order, with
% equal probability for each type of cue.
% 
% Reaction times (RT) and hit rates will be collected for each trial type
% to examine effects of reward-related and loss-avoidant speeding of RTs.
% Hit rates will be used to confirm experimental manipulation to maintain
% approximately 60% success.
% 
% Two runs of the task will be performed, each lasting 5 minutes for a
% total of twenty trials per condition (100 total trials,10 minutes).

%ADDITIONAL NOTES TO ADMINISTRATOR:
% 1. participants should be informed that it is real money and they will
% collect whatever they earn 
% 2. participants should be informed that the time changes on the target
% and thus PRESS AS FAST AS POSSIBLE for optimal outcomes
% 3. participants should be informed to try their best to press for neutral
% trials too, even though they won't gain or lose money.
%4. THE PRACTICE RUN MUST BE DONE BEFORE THE EXPERIMENT, in order to
%retrieve personalized timing files.
