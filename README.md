# MID-fMRI
Monetary Incentive Delay task for fMRI, for children

This is a task to be run in the scanner from MATLAB. All files are needed in order to run the script, as well as an empty folder labelled "data". 
The "makeEVs.py" must be modified per group and per location of log files. Currently set up for use on server. 

For additional task notes and references, see notes at top of MATLAB script!
